# Double-Blank-NPuzzle-AStar
Double blank N-Puzzle is a variant of the popular N-puzzle game. It consists of 2 blanks instead of the usual single blank. This repository contains a code solution that uses the A* search algorithm to solve this puzzle.

_Note: The C++ implementation has a lot of room for optimization and currently runs slower than the Python implementation._
